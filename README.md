This repository showcases the work I completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. Throughout the course, I learned foundational skills in data science, including data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and Python programming. I applied these skills through hands-on projects, where I explored real-world datasets and built models to solve problems. This certificate has equipped me with the tools and knowledge to pursue a career in data science and analytics.
